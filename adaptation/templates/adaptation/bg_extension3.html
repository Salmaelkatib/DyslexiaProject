      On Friday, the farmer decided to visit the town.  He walked down the busy </br>
      streets, buying bread and plums. He saw a doctor who looked upset. "Are </br>
      you alright?" he asked kindly. She smiled weakly, "I am fine, just tired from a </br>
      difficult trial."  They talked for a while, sharing stories and helpful advice.</br>
