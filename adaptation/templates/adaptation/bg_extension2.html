      Far away, a train chugged through a dense forest.On board, a little </br>
panda peeked through a window, seeing rainbows glistening beautifully </br>
after the rain. "This is an incredible adventure," said the zookeeper,</br> 
who gently held the panda. They were happily heading to a new school </br>
where nature was the primary language taught to everyone.
